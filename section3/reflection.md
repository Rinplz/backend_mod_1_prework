## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I wouldn't say anything mentioned was really brand new, but the open mindedness in the article
resonated well with me since I try to be open minded in everything I do. Focusing on the process of
reflection also resonated with me since just in this section I had used some brainstorming
with experience from other syntax to make multiple additions to an array with one command.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Being open minded and understanding that practice is essential for success are something
I've known for quite a while in everything I've done.  Unfortunately, I've always taken failure
particularly harshly so although I know making mistakes is part of the process of improvement,
I sometimes get hung up on feeling dumb for not knowing something as fast as I think I should

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A Hash is a way to store data similar to an Array, but is not ordered numerically,
instead linking values to keys

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {
  'bags_dog_food' => 15,
  'bags_cat_food' => 13,
  'chew_toys' => 34,
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states['Iowa']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys for keys; states.values for values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
Different classes for your character in an RPG would be good to use a has for since you
could list the different stats associated with each class such as 'STR' => 35, 'WIS' => 21

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I wouldn't say it's a question about hashes, but I'd like to see more hashes in published programs to
get some kind of experience looking at professional use
