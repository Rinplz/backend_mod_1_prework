## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I don't really have anything to add, since I don't think I'm particularly super when it comes to learning.
I think adopting the growth mindset is something that both resonated with me and I'd like to start doing.
I've always taken my mistakes regardless of how small extremely harshly, so seeing them more as an opportunity to improve would be better.
